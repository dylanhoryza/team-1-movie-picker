## Description
The motivation for this project is to utilize server-side APIs and work togetheras a team to fulfill our User Story and our Acceptance Criterias. Our team decided to build this project to utilize public APIs to hone in our skill and understand where challenges occured.

This project resolved a problem of deciding between two movies based off review ratings. The results after each commparison of two movies are stored in Local Storage and the sorted list of recommended movies are found at link on the top right of the page "Top Picks".

Our team learned how to work as a team to develop an application that can work with public APIs. The project taught our team to utilize a new CSS framework from Bulma and testing our changes with Google Developer. The APIs had us understand how to seek through data from the server and troubleshoot with the SCRIPT.
